            <span class="word2">Postmodern Manifesto</span>
            <br><span class="word2">1. The art of the past is past. What was true of art yesterday is false today.</span>
            <br><span class="word2">2. The Postmodern art of today is defined and determined, not by artists, but by a new generation of curators, philosophers and intellectuals ignorant of the past and able to ignore it.</span>
            <br><span class="word2">3. Postmodernism is a political undertaking, Marxist and Freudian.</span>
            <br><span class="word2">4. Postmodernism is a new cultural condition.</span>
            <br><span class="word2">5. Postmodernism is democratic and allied to popular culture.</span>
            <br><span class="word2">6. Postmodernism denies the possibility of High Art.</span>
            <br><span class="word2">7. Postmodernism deconstructs works of High Art to undermine them.</span>
            <br><span class="word2">8. Postmodernism is subversive, seditiously resembling the precedents it mimics.</span>
            <br><span class="word2">9. Postmodern art is pastiche, parody, irony, ironic conflict and paradox.</span>
            <br><span class="word2">10. Postmodern art is self-consciously shallow, stylistically hybrid, ambiguous, provocative and endlessly repeatable.</span>
            <br><span class="word2">11. Postmodern art is anti-elitist, but must protect its own elitism.</span>
            <br><span class="word2">12. To the Postmodernist every work of art is a text, even if it employs no words and has no title, to be curatorially interpreted.  Art cannot exist before it is interpreted.</span>
            <br><span class="word2">13. Postmodernist interpretation depends on coining new words unknown and unknowable to the masses, on developing a critical jargon of impenetrable profundity, and on a quagmire of theory with which to reinforce endowed significance. Vive le Neologisme!</span>
